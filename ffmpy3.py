        one string, even if it contains spaces (see *Examples* for more info).

        is used for output, ``stdout`` must be redirected to a pipe by passing `subprocess.PIPE` as
        ``stdout`` argument.

        Note that the parent process is responsible for reading any output from stdout/stderr. This
        should be done even if the output will not be used since the process may otherwise deadlock.

        from the pipes as necessary.
